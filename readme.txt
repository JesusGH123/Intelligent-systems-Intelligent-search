The file named "city_graph.txt" has all the cities paths. It has the source and target city and the third element is the distance between them.

If you want to add new cities please add each city without space (i.e SanLuisPotosi)

To compile main.cpp just run the program and enter the source and target city, then you will get the path using greedy algorithm and the second one is using A* which uses heuristics.
